        info: 'Bitcoin (BTC) is the most widely used digital cash at present. It was born on November 2008. It is a kind of digital encrypted currency transmitted by peer-to-peer (P2P), with a total of 21 million. Bitcoin network releases a certain amount of coins every 10 minutes and is expected to reach its limit in 2140. Bitcoin is called "digital gold" by investors. Bitcoin is generated by a large number of calculations according to a specific algorithm and does not depend on the issuance of a specific currency institution. It uses a distributed database composed of a large number of nodes in the entire P2P network to confirm and record all transactions. Cryptographic design is used to ensure the security of all aspects of currency circulation, which can ensure that the currency cannot be artificially manipulated by mass production of bitcoin. Cryptographic design allows bitcoin to be transferred, paid and redeemed only by the real owner. It also ensures the anonymity of currency ownership and circulation transactions.
